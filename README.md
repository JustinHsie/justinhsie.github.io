### About me
Hello! My name is Justin Hsie, and I'm a self-taught software developer.  

I've always loved creating and building things, but it was during my masters program in biostatistics that I discovered my love for programming and the thrill of seeing my code come to life. But I wanted learn the art of writing good code and not settle for "just getting it to work". This mindset and innate curiosity for what happens under the hood is what led me to software development.  

Soon after, I became immersed in teaching myself everything I could about this new world and all it has to offer. I was fascinated by all the different technologies, design patterns, and best practices one could employ to approach the same problem, all in pursuit of writing better code; and I've been hooked ever since!  

In my spare time I like writing and producing music, keeping up with soccer leagues, and trying out new coffee beans for my morning coffee.
