### About me
Hi! My name is Justin Hsie, and I'm a Master of Science graduate in Biostatistics from Columbia University.

I aim to use my statistical and programming skills to build interesting things and perform useful and insightful data analyses.

In my spare time I like writing and producing music, keeping up with soccer leagues, and trying out new coffee beans for my morning coffee.
